Purpose: This assignment designed to apply my learnings around javascript and create a password generator that had the following functions:
    1) Allowed the user to define the length of the password with a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters.
    2) Allow the user to customize their password by allowing the inclusion and exclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their password. 
    3) Provided the necessary data validations to assure accurate generation of passwords included returning the user to the proper input session  if the inputted data was not expected or valid.
    4) A calculation routine that quickly and randomly generated a password based upon the user's preferences. 
    5) The password result would be written and displayed to the page.
